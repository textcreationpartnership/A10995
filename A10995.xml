         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Concerning the accompliſhment of this prophecie, and the true meaning of the words, there bee two queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons propounded; the firſt is by Iewes, who denie this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of the comming of <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to be fulfilled, and the ſecond, by Chriſtians, who demaund how this prophecie of <hi>Iudah</hi> was accompliſhed?</p>
            <p>For the firſt; when the Iewes ſince the comming of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16628:40"/>
Chriſt, haue bin vrged with this text of Scripture, to proue that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is alreadie come, they cauill, and ſay that by the word <hi>Shebeth,</hi> which ſignifieth a <hi>Scepter,</hi> or a <hi>Rod;</hi> is onely vnderſtood that <hi>Affliction,</hi> which the Iewes ſhould endure till <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> indeed it cannot bee denied, but that <hi>Shebeth,</hi> or a <hi>Rod,</hi> betokeneth <hi>Tribulation</hi> &amp; <hi>oppreſſion;</hi> for ſo it is taken in the ſecond pſalme, where <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith<note n="(q)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.9.</note> 
               <hi>thou ſhalt bruiſe them with a rod of Iron, &amp; breake them in peeces like a potters veſſell;</hi> yet it cannot beare that meaning in this place, for the wordes following. <hi>Nor a Law-giuer from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his feete,</hi> doe ſhewe that it is here taken for a <hi>Scepter,</hi> rather then the rod of <hi>Affliction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, ſome of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> read the words thus. <hi>The Scepter ſhal not depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iudah after that Meſſiah is come,</hi> for he (ſay they) ſhall reſtore the kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> thus they imagine and dreame that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall bee a <hi>Temporall Monarch,</hi> but this doth flatly repugne, both the meaning of <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp; the letter of the <hi>Text,</hi> which cannot beare any ſuch interpretation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Rabbi Salomon</hi> granteth that according to this prophecie, the <hi>Scepter ſhall continue in the tribe of Iudah, till Meſſiah come,</hi> but yet he denieth that <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as yet in thoſe Regions which lie about <hi>Media, Aſſiria, Babylon,</hi> and mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> the Iewes haue regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and principalities; but this is moſt ridiculous, for it is notoriouſly euident to all the world, that they haue no commonwealth in <hi>Chanaan,</hi> the <hi>Land</hi> of promiſe, of which place onely <hi>Iacob</hi> ſpake; &amp; if they haue any regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the prouinces about <hi>Media, Aſſiriah, Babylon,</hi> &amp; mount <hi>Cauca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> it is not abſolute; for they are tributaries and ſubiects to other Kings, as to the <hi>Perſian,</hi> the <hi>Great Turk</hi> &amp; others.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, ſome hebrewes take <hi>Shiloh</hi> for the proper name of that citie where the <hi>Arke</hi> of God continued a long time, whereupon they make this expoſition, <hi>The Scepter</hi> ſhall not depart from <hi>Iudah,</hi> till <hi>Shiloh</hi> come: that is to ſay, till <hi>Saul</hi> be annointed King in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and till <hi>Hieroboam</hi> be made King ouer Iſrael; in this ſhort gloſſe, there be many
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16628:40"/>
errours; firſt neither <hi>Saul,</hi> nor <hi>Hieroboa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> called him vnto the aſſemblie, and made him King ouer al <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet the <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Iudah</hi> &amp; <hi>Beniamin</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the houſe of <hi>Dauid;</hi> in which family the <hi>Scepter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the comming of <hi>Shiloh;</hi> thirdly, <hi>Shiloh</hi> the citie in the time of K. <hi>Saul</hi> was <hi>forſaken</hi> and became deſolate; the comming of <hi>Shiloh</hi> then is improperly taken for the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine</hi> and <hi>deſolation</hi> thereof.</p>

            <p>Concerning the ſecond queſtion, it ariſeth amongſt vs that bee Chriſtians, who are much troubled about the accompliſhment of this Prophecie; namely, how, and when it tooke place.</p>
            <p>The Iſraelites had foure kinde of gouernements: the firſt by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſuah,</hi> who were Captaines, and this continued threeſcore and ſix yeares, for <hi>Moſes</hi> ruled them fortie yeares, and <hi>Ioſuah</hi> twentie ſix; the ſecond was by <hi>Iudges,</hi> from <hi>Othoniel</hi> vnto <hi>Samuel,</hi> for the ſpace of three hundreth and thirtie yeares; the third by Kings till the captiuitie, to wit, from <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Zedechiah,</hi> fiue hundreth and thirteene years; &amp; the fourth by Prieſtes, that were as Kings vntill <hi>Herod,</hi> fiue hundreth and twentie yeares, now

theſe alterations of the ſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being conſidered, wherein wee finde, that vnleſſe it were onely vnder the kings, the gouernment was leaſt of all exerciſed by the Tribe of <hi>Iudah;</hi> I would know how this can be iuſtified, that <hi>The Scepter did not depart from</hi> Iudah <hi>till</hi> Meſſiah <hi>came?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euſebius</hi> is of opinion, that by theſe words of Iacob,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. <hi>8.</hi> de praepar. Euangel.</note> 
               <hi>The Scepter</hi> is not ſtrictly and neceſſarily tyed to the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> till the comming of <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> but onely a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie in reſpect of the other Tribes; which might be, though the other Tribes had ſometimes the regall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; but this is not probable, for the word <hi>Scepter,</hi> or as it is in the <hi>hebrew, The regal Rod;</hi> or as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> readeth it, <hi>a Prince,</hi> doeth manifeſtly note a ſupreme power &amp; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie; now how could <hi>Iudah</hi> haue the principalitie, or be accounted the chiefeſt Tribe, when another had the imperiall authoritie; ſeeing then that till the time of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> the <hi>Scepter</hi> was neuer in <hi>Iudah,</hi> but onely when <hi>Otho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> and <hi>Ibzah</hi> did <hi>Iudge Iſrael;</hi> how can the prophecie of <hi>Iacob</hi> be fulfilled? this expoſition of <hi>Euſebius</hi> then doth no whit at all cleare this point in controuerſie; wherefore I thinke with <hi>Pererius,</hi> that the meaning of <hi>Iacob</hi> is this, <hi>When the tribe of Iudah ſhall be abſolutely poſſeſſed of the Scepter, it ſhall keepe it continually till Shiloh come;</hi> there was a beginning of <hi>Iudahs</hi> principalitie, when after the death of <hi>Ioſuah,</hi> his Tribe was appointed by God to be as a <hi>Captaine</hi> to the reſt; and likewiſe in the gouernment of <hi>Othoniel</hi> and <hi>Ibzah,</hi> but when <hi>Dauid</hi> was annointed and inſtalled, then was the <hi>Scepter</hi> confirmed in him, and entailed as it were to his poſteritie; wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without any interruption, till <hi>Zedekiah</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away captiue to <hi>Babylon;</hi> but afterwards, how it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained vntill the comming of Chriſt in the familie of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> is the greateſt matter in queſtion.</p>
